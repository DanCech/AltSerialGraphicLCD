This resource is an update of Jon Green's AltSerialGraphicLCD library for the Sparkfun serial Graphic LCD Backpack that supports both the small (128x64) and large (160x128) screen versions. The same firmware may be used for both screens. The drivers for both are significantly different from both the Jennifer Holt and Sparkfun original libraries in that the chip specifications for both the KS0108B and TS6963 are followed which significantly improves performance.

The bundle includes the firmware and GLCD library for the Arduino that manages Software Serial flow control.

Details of the library, firmware and details of programming the backpack are documented in the PDF documentation
